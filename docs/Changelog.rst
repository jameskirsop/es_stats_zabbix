Changelog
=========

0.9.1 (? ? ?)
-------------

**Alpha-release of pending 1.0 version**

  * Basically a complete rewrite.  This version is not yet ready for mass
    consumption.  Still pending are:
    - Zabbix templates
    - Tests
    - Installation scripts/config files
    - Endpoints
    - Init scripts for the backend (SysV, Upstart, systemd)
    - Documentation
    - Compatibility testing with different versions of Elasticsearch and
    Zabbix, to say nothing of different Python client versions.
  * Testing this pre-release version requires a ``git clone`` and manual
    dependency installation.

**New**

  * Flask-based backend listener that enables cached reads of the cluster
    stats. This prevents repeated calls from completely hammering the cluster
    with repeated stats calls. Currently intended to listen on localhost port
    7600, so that the Zabbix UserParameter script can simply read localhost.
    Cache timeout defaults to 60 seconds, and is configurable.
  * Use YAML based configuration.
    - Elasticsearch configuration block
    - Logging configuration block
    - Backend configuration block
    - `do_not_discover` block
  * Uses update `es_stats` and new `es_client` modules.
    - `es_client` allows monitoring of X-Pack secured Elasticsearch clusters
  * Discovery based on value (``bool`` for true/false, ``unsigned`` for
    Zabbix's `unsigned` integer values, ``float``, and ``character``).  This
    allows Zabbix to automatically discover items for the correct item type.
  * Block individual endpoints from LLD by enumerating them in the
    ``do_not_discover`` block in the configuration file.

**Interim Fix List**

  * Fixed issues with the config_override function not behaving as expected.

0.1.4 (22 June 2016)
--------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * Fix ``es_stats`` dependency to be 0.2.1, which fixes some reported bugs.

**General**

  * Fix docs in their as yet incomplete state to at least not have incorrect
    information

0.1.1 (7 October 2015)
----------------------

**New**

  * Batch now reports count of items which failed on command-line.  This
    enables you to call batch as a Zabbix agent item, and report a result.

**Bug Fixes**

  * Prevent empty lists in batches from generating an error.

0.1.0 (7 October 2015)
----------------------
